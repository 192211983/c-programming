Yes, that is correct. In the example you provided, the largest element in the array is 100. This can be determined by comparing each element of the array to a variable that initially holds the value of the first element, and then updating that variable with the value of any element that is larger. Alternatively, the standard library function "max" can be used to find the maximum value in an array.
